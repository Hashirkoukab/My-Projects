# Power BI Data Visualisation
I have created the visualization report of a Cookie Company for three years sales, profit, risks, monthly and yearly revenue and
overall business overview through visualization of the data found in their sheetes.


Step 1: Gathered data from different sources i.e database, website, and inventory regoinal files.

Step 2: Cleaned the data using Power Query and Exel.

Step 3: Loaded all datasets into Power Query Editor for intial cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns,
handeled missing data, and standardized formats (e.g.< dates and currencies ).

Step 4: Applied transformations such as filtering rows, splitting columns, and creating calculated columns for essential metrics (like "Total Revenue" and
"Sales Growth").

Step 5: Used "Merge" and "Append" functions to combine tables, ensuring a seamless link between tables to enable accurate, integrated analysis across data sources
and customer insights.

Step 6: Performed Data Modeling, established relationships between tables to enable accurate, integrated anlysis across data sources
(e.g., linked "Customer ID" across sales and feed back tables).

Step 7: Created visualizations, presented sales data in donut chart, showing sum of units sold by country.

Step 8: Presented Sum of Revenue by Date and Location a beautiful clustered stacked bar chart.

Step 9: Created a stacked bar chart to visualize sum of profit by location.

Step 10: Added a table at the top of the dashboard to present an overview of all the data and visualizations we created,
including country name, date, day, time, sum of profits, units sold, product name, sum of revenue.

Step 11: Added a slicer on top right corner to select location wise data on each visual we created.

Step 12: Then I created a live dynamic Map visual we created.

Step 13: Added a Slicer on page 1 to select country wise data with a single click.

Step 14: I created a colorful pie chart to show our monthly and yearly revenue by date.

Step 15: To visualize the yearly profit by date I created a Line Chart to easily see profit date wise.

Step 16: Created Mobile-App version and Web-App dashboard to present data to our client easily on both the platforms.
